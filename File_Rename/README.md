# File Search Toolkit

## Info
A self-built File Rename based on Python

## Setup
1. Setup the path to the target folder you want to rename files inside (use your own username instead of yutong).
   - eg. If you use Mac: '/Users/{username}/Forever/Software/
2. Run test.py 'root_folder' 'key_word' 'replacement' to see the name change in the target folder
   - eg. python test.py 'word' '/Users/yutong/Forever/Software/Python/' 'CaiNiao' 'LiaoXuefeng'
3. See the name change

## Future
To be continued
